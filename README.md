# sharp.js
Front-end library for developers that want the power of a framework without the commitment

Sharp.js is a library to make common DOM manipulation with Ajax and mustache templates simple and easy.

##But Aren't There Already A Million Front-End Frameworks Out There?

That's true, but the problem is they are frameworks. They hijack everything you do and are difficult to work around. I prefer my tools to work for me, not the other way around.

Frameworks also build too many new paradigms that may or may not be useful. Sharp.js builds on top of the standard rules of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, not naively invent something new.
